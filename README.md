# DESCRIPTION

    MMNT ("Moment") is a note taking web-based application intended for open-ended use across two text fields and two accompanying "pin" areas. A flexible and simple tool intended for any person's frequent and daily use, allowing one to document any sort of information freely.

    The purpose of MMNT is to foster daily productivity and organization at a smaller scope than a planner or calendar with the ability to move through dynamic thoughts or ideas flexibly and freely.
